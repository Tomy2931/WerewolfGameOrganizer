# WereWolf Game Organizer

The idea for this project came from a card game I have. The setup of this game consists of villagers and wolves, which depends on the number of players. The characters also have points to balance the teams. I managed to automate all this, instead of doing everything mentally, to make it more practical.

To clarify, it is not a game, it is just a system for organizing a physical card game.

# How To Use

-The use is simple, you add the number of players (min 6, max 20).

-Depending on the number of players, there will be more Werewolves

-Click in the village cards to select characters, and the same with the werewolves

-In the middle there is a points comparator, that will indicate how many points difference there is between the two teams (Red for wolves, blue for villagers), and you can change the cards to balance the teams clicking in a card with a character already selected.

-Press the Ready Button

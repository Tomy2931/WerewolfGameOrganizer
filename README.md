# WereWolf Game Organizer

The idea for this project came from a card game I have. The setup of this game consists of villagers and wolves, which depends on the number of players. The characters also have points to balance the teams. I managed to automate all this, instead of doing everything mentally, to make it more practical.

To clarify, it is not a game, it is just a system for organizing a physical card game.
